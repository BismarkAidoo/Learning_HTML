# Html - Tables
In this project, I learned that a table in `HTML` consists of table `cells` inside `rows` and `columns`.

## Components
- A table cell is defined by a `<td>` and a `</td>` tag, where `td` stands for table `data`.

- A table cell is defined by a `<tr>` and a `</tr>` tag, where `tr` stands for table `row`.

- A table cell is defined by a `<th>` and a `</th>` tag, where `th` stands for table `header`.
