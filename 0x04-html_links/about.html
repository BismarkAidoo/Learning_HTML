        <h2>Explore the beauty of nature as you Visit Ghana</h2>
        <p>Ghana has a long and fascinating history. It was home to ancient empires and kingdoms, including the Ashanti Empire, which was known for its wealth and trade in gold and other resources. The area that is now Ghana has seen the influence of various European powers, including the Portuguese, British, and Dutch, during the era of the transatlantic slave trade. Ghana gained independence from British colonial rule on March 6, 1957, becoming the first African country to achieve independence from European colonial powers.</p>
